So far, I have learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage projects efficiently. I now understand how to create repositories, make commits, and collaborate with others using branches and pull requests.

This knowledge has helped me track changes in my work, resolve conflicts, and contribute to projects in a team setting effectively.
